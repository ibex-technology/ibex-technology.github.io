### Cultural Places - Oroundo Mobile GmbH
Oroundo mobile operates the platform (Culturalplaces)[https://www.culturalplaces.com] that sells tour guides and tickets to cultural venues like museums. The company wants to develop the platform towards a community for people that work in the cultural industry. The "cultural people" can find funding, collaboration partners and fans in the community. 

In the first stage of the product we launched a token ($CPTC) and a "StoreFront"-application that sells tickets, redeemable vouchers, art and media files as NFTs. In the second stage the platform will evolve into a DAO-governed community that is self-managing.
