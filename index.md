### Cultural Places - Oroundo Mobile GmbH
Oroundo mobile operates the platform [Culturalplaces](https://www.culturalplaces.com) that sells tour guides and tickets to cultural venues like museums. The company wants to develop the platform towards a community for people that work in the cultural industry. The "cultural people" can find funding, collaboration partners and fans in the community.

<p>In the first stage of the product we launched a token ($CPTC) and a "StoreFront"-application that sells tickets, redeemable vouchers, art and media files as NFTs. In the second stage the platform will evolve into a DAO-governed community that is self-managing.</p>
